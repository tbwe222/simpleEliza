# simpleEliza

an interactive chat-bot type program. Eliza is a therapist program that interacts with the user. 
the program will evaluate what the user asks and turn the user's input into a question that sounds like the therapist really cares.

If the user types in "I am feeling great" or enter "Q", the program will stop running. 
the program should print out the last input (as an output) every time before accepting new input. 
Make sure you are accommodating for NO case-sensitivity. (Q is the same as q)
